# navmesh-generation sketch

This sketch generates a navigation mesh from input geometry using the approach from the Recast C++ implementation. Most of the code is directly adapted from the C++ library with some modifications.

The intent of this isn't to remain a faithful port of recast and may change if this is developed further.
